# SetLibrary
Recreation of standard-like generic Set<T> classes based on arrays (ArraySet<T>), linked list (LinkedSet<T>), and hash table (HashSet<T>).

All classes implement an ISet<T> interface, which provides a unified behaviour for sets based on different data structures.

Also the library will contain an UnmutableSet<T> and SetUtils classes for extended functionality.
